# DWSS to CSV

DWSS to CSV is a command line program that reads Excel workbooks (AKA .xlsx files) provided by Disney Worldwide Shared Services (DWSS) and emits CSVs with clean data.

Though it was created for that specific purpose, the source code itself is unaware of the workbook format being considered. At runtime a JSON document that describes the datasets within the workbook is read from the filesystem. By altering this declarative schema file, the program can be adapted (even by less-technical users) to keep pace with evolution in a workbook's schemaâ€”or repurposed entirely, for totally new datasets in other workbooks.

Developers: see [DEVELOPING](DEVELOPING.md).
